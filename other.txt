Initially, started GUI with this, but it didn't work best for me dumped it
"""
from tkinter import *
window = Tk()
label = Label(window, text="Hello, Tkinter!")
label.pack()
window.mainloop()
root = Tk()

root.title('Login form')


root.mainloop()

"""

I was trying this code in order to activate Label class
"""
window = tk.Tk()
label = tk.Label(window, text = "Hello, Tkinter!")
label.pack()
window.mainloop()
"""

ADDING FUNCTIONALITY IN GUI
In order to add functionality, we use command in tkinter

Now, I am going to add functionality like:
- adding email restrictions
- error credentials
- login successfull (correct credentials)

- next buttons
