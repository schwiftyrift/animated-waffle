This program is an automated Lost and Found system written in Pyton that utilizes object detection to label and store lost items in a database. This database is searchable, allowing people to find their lost items by a search, or be notified when an item matching their description if the item is not in the system.

Program by Jared Newton, Damjan Pavlovic, Rakesh Gupta for the CSC132 Freshman Design Expo
